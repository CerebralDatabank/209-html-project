            <center><b><u>Silver Taps</u></b></center>
            <p>Texas A&M University is well-known for its traditions and the stories/reasons behind those traditions. One of Texas A&M University well known traditions is Silver Taps. Silver Taps is a remembrance made to honor members of the Aggie Family. This remembrance gathers all Aggies on campus on the first Tuesday of each month to honor students who have passed since the last Silver Taps ceremony. Silver Taps is a beautiful tradition that all Aggies cherish and love. This tradition has become one of the most important traditions on campus as it brings all Aggies on campus together as one to support those who have passed.
