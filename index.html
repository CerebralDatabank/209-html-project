            <center><p> <b>Silver Taps</b> is a <a href="https://youtu.be/GeyX8d_TiCw?si=qa7ROKJ06Zu66Tnk" target="_blank">a tradition unique to Texas A&M</a> and was held for the first time starting in 1898. It is held on the first Tuesday of each month to honor students at A&M who have passed away. The ceremonies are held from September to April at the <i>Academic Plaza</i>. The day of the ceremony, students can write letters to the families of the fallen Aggies. The ceremony starts that night at 10:15 pm, all lights on campus are required to be turned off. Families of the fallen and students gather silently in the <i>Academic Plaza</i> while hymns are played on the Albritton Bell Tower. At 10:30 pm, a three-volley salute is fired once the Ross Volunteer Company arrives. After the last round is fired, <a href="https://youtu.be/cZHGWlTU_8U?si=KiQKOLuPiDaNjINL" target="_blank">buglars begin to play</a> "<b>Silver Taps</b>" while atop the Academic Building. It is played three times: once to the north, south, and west. However, <i>never</i> to the east because it is believed that "<u>the sun will never rise on that Aggie again.</u>"</p></center>
