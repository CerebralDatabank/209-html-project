            <center><p>Hi! My name is Jasmine Bonilla and I am a Public Health Major from Houston, TX. My current goal is to get into nursing school, but I'd also like to run a small business in the future! I've always been very passionate about nursing, but I also have a huge passion for business. Business is involved in everything, which is why I chose to do a business minor. I think it'd really impact the way I think and problem-solve. Some of my favorite things are ice cream, soccer, attending concerts, and painting!</p></center>
